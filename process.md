Adjusting stars from here on:

3. Affinity

Select>Select Sampled Colour

Single click on a bright star to sample it

For the colour model, try Intensityâ€”alternatively, if you're dealing with rich colour stars, you may want to try RGB or CIELAB.

Adjust tolerance as required, click Apply

Select>Grow/Shrink, grow selection as required

Optionally, Select>Feather to feather the selection

Now go to Layer>New Live Filter Layer>Blur>Minimum Blur and adjust Radius to suit

At any point, you can change the Minimum Blur layer's Radius parameter, or even change its Opacity if the effect is too strong.
