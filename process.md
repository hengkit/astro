For the colour model, try Intensityâ€”alternatively, if you're dealing with rich colour stars, you may want to try RGB or CIELAB.
Adjust tolerance as required, click Apply
Select>Grow/Shrink, grow selection as required
Optionally, Select>Feather to feather the selection
Now go to Layer>New Live Filter Layer>Blur>Minimum Blur and adjust Radius to suit
At any point, you can change the Minimum Blur layer's Radius parameter, or even change its Opacity if the effect is too strong.
